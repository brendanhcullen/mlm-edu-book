# Getting started with R

Probably need to have at least a basic intro here talking about how we'll be using R and how it may differ from other people who use R. We should also probably put together an R package for the book.

For now, I'm just going to see if I can get a [{learnr}]() tutorial to work.

First, install the [esvis]() package:

```{r install-esvis, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("esvis")
```

Now load the package and look at the data

```{r load-esvis, exercise = TRUE}
library(esvis)
library(tidyverse)
tibble(esvis)
```

This code will 

```{r letter-a, echo=FALSE}
question("What number is the letter A in the English alphabet?",
  answer("8"),
  answer("14"),
  answer("1", correct = TRUE),
  answer("23")
)
```
